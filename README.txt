The Grumman Goose (G-21A, JRF-5)
--------------------------------

The Grumman Goose flying boat was designed in 1936 at the request of wealthy Long Island businessmen. It was then a very practical design, for airfields were far less common and often rough, and the ability to land on water was essential to reach many areas. 345 examples were built, the first in May of 1937 and the last coming off the Grumman lines in 1945. Most models went to the US military, serving in observation, anti-submarine, search and rescue, utility, and test roles. The name "Goose" was given to the aircraft by the RAF, where it was used for navigation and observation training as well as communications.

My model is representative of a Goose flying during the 50's through the 70's in charter services around the world. It is not true to any particular version, as my sources come from many versions. In theory it is based on the naval version of the Goose, the JRF-5, for which I have many photos. It may also be viewed as a G-21A, built for civilian aviation, employed by the military during WWII and then converted back to civilian uses. By the 50's, most Gooses had undergone many modifications, some necessary to return them to civil service, others by the various operators according to their means and needs, so this situation is not unreasonable.

The aircraft uses a pair of Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Juniors turning post-war 3-bladed Hartzell governing propellers. The engines have nine cylinders, are direct-drive rather than geared-down, and feature a single-stage engine-driven centrifugal type supercharger. Fuel is stored in two 110 gallon tanks, one in each wing between the engine nacelle and fuselage, for a total of 220 gallons. Ferrying range is approximately 700 nautical miles. The Goose is fitted out for 2 crew members and 4-6 passengers, with up to 300 pounds of gear stored forward in the bow compartment, and 400 pounds in the stern compartment. Empty weight is about 6000lbs, gross weight around 8000lbs, making a useful load of around 2000lbs, though a max fuel load of 1320lbs can eat up much of this. Stock Gooses did not have retractable wing floats or water rudders, but many surviving Gooses have been fitted with retractable floats, though these have been reported to be mechanically troublesome. A few are fitted with water rudders, and at least one has an extended rudder root for better handling. I have kept my Goose largely stock, though at some point I may offer a retractable floats option.

The Goose is provided as-is, with no guarantees. I am not a pilot, and regrettably I've yet to see a real Goose. The model is approaching something reasonable, but there is very much cockpit and cabin work to be done, as well as refinement of the exterior. The model itself is fairly accurate in most places, and moderately accurate in others. For the fuselage I had access to engineering drawings showing exact placement of formers and stringers and other details. For flight surfaces and engine nacelles my information was more spotty and so draws on variety of sources to get something close. The wing accurately reflects the airfoils used. Unfortunately, unlike my Lockheed 1049H Constellation model I don't have a friend with a real Goose cockpit, so many cockpit dimensions and placements are more guesswork than I would like. Surviving Gooses are nearly all modified in many ways, so there's quite a bit of latitude.

Among fans of the Goose, it's said one should say "Gooses" rather than "Geese". And so I do. ;)

Standard Loads:

The default Goose load is 30% fuel, a single pilot, and a few hundred pounds of gear in the passenger cabin. For more challenging flights, play with these values using the Equipment menu. In the future I may set up a more elaborate configuration to allow different weight distribution across the various compartments or fuselage stations.

Note that the default load gives you enough fuel for tooling around an airport, but you should increase it for any serious flight.


Engine Basics:

starting:

switch on batteries and generator (behind co-pilot seat)
mixture full rich
throttle 1/4 to 1/2 open
ignition on
press starter til engine catches
throttle back to 500-800 RPM

warm-up:

As soon as engine oil pressure reaches reaches 50 psi, move prop to full INCREASE RPM.
Let oil come within 70-90 psi, then adjust engine to 1000-1400 RPM at full rich.
Oil temp should be over 40C and not above 90C.
Cylinder temp should not exceed 230C.

Take-off power limit: 1 min at 2300 RPM @ 36.5 inHg
Max continuous power: 2200 RPM @ 33.5 inHg full rich

More information on the Goose engines can be found under the file NOTES_ENGINES.txt.


Take-Off:

Flaps to 30 degrees
Tail wheel locked
Mixture full rich
RPM full increase (pitch full fine)
Throttle 80-100%

Pull back on the stick as the aircraft accelerates, keeping the tail firmly on the ground. Let the aircraft lift itself off in this posture, then relax the stick as necessary. In the default configuration the aircraft will climb rapidly. Retract flaps above 110 knots. Be ready with strong early rudder correction when dealing with crosswinds.

Water take-offs are generally easier. Begin your run keeping the aircraft fairly level rather than pulling back on the stick-- you want to build up speed to get 'on the step', in other words, start planing over the water rather than pushing through it. Keep the nose up just enough to keep from ploughing through the water, then when you feel you have enough speed, start pulling back on the stick until you lift off. For a challenge, try this with heavy loads.


Crosswinds:

The Goose hates crosswinds. The real aircraft is rated to 13 knot crosswinds (22 on water), but many operators restricted it to much less on land. Practice take-offs and landings with little or no crosswinds or you may quickly become frustrated with the Goose. On take-off, set rudder to turn away from the wind slightly and be prepared to use differential braking, touching the leeward brake as necessary until you have rudder authority. Avoid over-correcting or you will yaw like crazy.


Landing:

Make sure your tail wheel is locked. Approach at 70-80 knots with flaps at 30 degrees or full (60 degrees). Throttle well back-- with the default load the Goose glides fairly well and long. Apply full flaps and add some power when nearing the threshold. Like many tail-draggers, try to almost stall the aircraft in, allowing the aircraft to settle toward a 3-point landing with touchdown around 60 knots. The plane will definitely stall around 57, but touchdown needs to be slow or the aircraft will bounce or ground-loop. Once the plane touches, keep elevator full back and retract flaps. Be prepared to use differential braking to maintain heading, especially if there is any crosswind. The Goose has a narrow wheelbase and a high center of gravity; this makes it tippy, so it's important to land gently and smoothly.

Landing on water is generally pretty easy and much more forgiving. Water landings make good practice before tackling ground landings.

Note that the Goose's landing gear are manually lowered by a hand crank between the cockpit seats (currently not modeled). As such, the gear takes more time than usual to raise/lower, so make sure you allocate sufficient time when making ground landings.


Flight Tips:

Best cruise can be attained by decreasing the RPM to 1500-1700 RPM, and leaning the mixture about 4-5 notches (70-75%) using the hotspots. Max airspeed is about 165 knots, more practical is around 140-150. Slower speeds will yield much better range. Avoid operating the engine above 27.5 inHg for extended periods.

The Goose is particularly prone to wingtip stalls at low speeds. There is no wingtip twist, so near stall speeds you'll have little or no aileron response. Beware of turning too tightly under 90 kts or you could find yourself tipping over to one side and dropping very fast. Stall is approximately 57 knots at full flaps and using the default load.

Note that the Goose does not have flight-adjustable aileron trim tabs, only a small ground-adjustable aileron tab found on the right aileron of some examples for balance corrections. In level cruising flight, the aircraft will tend to pull to the left. You'll have to use rudder trim to correct, and this will vary considerably with your speed. The Goose was designed in '36 and from what I have read always was a seat-of-your-pants kind of bush plane, so I suspect this was not an issue for the kinds of short service flights the Goose typically made. Note that in the real aircraft the rudder trim tab is offset a predetermined number of degrees with the cockpit trim control centered at 0 degrees. Currently I don't model this.


Ground Handling:

The Goose is not hard to taxi on the ground with practice. The key is to learn to toggle the tail wheel caster into locked and unlocked configuration quickly and at the right moment, coupled with differential braking and/or differential power. For this reason the tail wheel is mapped to the 'L' key rather than 'ctrl-L' for quick keyboard access and to be near the differential braking keys, ',' and '.', which you'll use a lot when operating the Goose. Keep the aircraft under 15 knots on the ground and make slow, controlled turns. Tap the brake opposite the direction of turn to check your turn rate. It helps to anticipate rather than react to what the plane is doing.


Water Handling:

Water handling is tricky but possible. Handling will be best at very low speeds and light or no winds. Rudder will have little effect at low speeds and there is no water rudder, so the key here is differential power and anticipating the plane's reactions. Apply power in bursts-- avoid leaving a throttle open. As the aircraft begins a turn in the desired direction, immediately back down power and prepare to throw in some power from the other engine to check the turn. With practice the Goose can be maneuvered in this way, but do not try it in narrow passages without much practice. Note that significant winds make water handling difficult.

Note on wake animations: A change in CVS Flightgear causes the objects used to display wakes to 'collide' with the aircraft, thus triggering a crash situation for CVS users. Until this is resolved by the developers or I can model wakes using particle effects, wake animations are disabled.


Anchoring:

When on water, the aircraft can be anchored. Use the special menu options to first open the bow doors, then throw out the anchor. You cannot anchor the Goose without first opening the bow doors, as that is where the anchor and line are stored. When anchored, the Goose may bounce around a bit, but will eventually settle down.


Instruments:

The instruments are representative of those common in the 50's and 60's. Early Gooses had only the most necessary instruments of the period-- there wasn't much space on the main panel, and JRF Gooses often had an early autopilot taking up much of the space in the middle arch section (which must have made bow compartment access a chore).

Hotspots typically work using the left-click and middle-click mouse buttons, or whatever you have these buttons mapped to. Typically left-click increments and middle-click decrements, but not all work the same (with propeller RPM, left click decrements RPM). Some are toggles, and the clock is somewhat more complex than the others. Play with them to see how they work. Note that the RPM hotspot has a duplicate spot near the throttle quadrant for visual convenience.

The control position instrument to the right of the VSI is for keyboard and mouse flyers like me who lack feedback on control positions. It is not a real instrument (though it is based on a real trim position instrument taken from my Lockheed 1049H model). If you wish to remove it, go to the file "models/Goose_Instruments.xlm", locate references to 'ctl_pos', and comment out or remove the relevant sections.

The 'AUX' switch on the main junction box currently has no function.


Fuel Management:

There are two fuel level indicators located behind and above the cockpit seats for the left and right tanks. These fuel indictors are not yet labeled or calibrated, so they serve only as a general indicator. When the fuel level disappears at the bottom of the red zone, that tank is empty. Play with the fuel menu to get a feel for fuel level representations.

Tank selection and management is not yet implemented.


Liveries:

Four liveries are provided with the package. The first, Catalina Seaplanes, is representative of the Goose's golden age when they were used to shuttle people to Catalina Island off the coast of California. Many people fondly remember the plane from this period, from the 50's lasting til the early 80's, when helicopters and fast boats largely replaced the flying boats. The second is "Cutter's Goose" from the short-lived early 80's TV show "Tales of the Golden Monkey". There are two other unfinished liveries: a rather striking scarlet & black livery in use by a Goose that is (as far as I know) still flying, and my own livery design, influenced by various charter services and too much island dreaming. For those interested in making liveries, texture maps or base PSD files can be provide upon request.
